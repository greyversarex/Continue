# Bunyod-Tour Backend API

## Overview
Bunyod-Tour is a comprehensive tourism booking platform for Central Asia, offering tour, hotel, and guide booking, secure payments, and administrative management. It aims to provide a seamless user experience and efficient tools for administrators, supporting multilingual content and diverse payment methods. The project targets significant market potential by modernizing and streamlining regional tourism services.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Development approach: Improve existing files rather than creating new ones. User prefers enhancement of existing admin-dashboard.html over creation of separate admin panels.
Frontend structure alignment: Admin panel must perfectly match the frontend homepage structure with exact block names and tour organization as shown in provided screenshots.
System integration preference: User requires simplified and unified pricing systems with single source of truth. Eliminated complex manual categorization in favor of automatic detection.
